## Proximity Notifications

Traditional marketing is too expensive! You can put an advertisement for your business in many places but get minimal results. The solution? Get your regular customers to come in more often and spend more at your business with each visit.

How? Proximity Notifications.

These notifications appear instantly on your customers phone screens when they are close to your business.

### Why it Works

Because your customers are close by when they receive a notification for your business they are motivated to come inside and check out your latest products and promotions. 

**60-70% of returning customers make a purchase!** Compared to only 5-20% for a new customer visiting your business the first time.

What if I want to send notifications to customers that aren't nearby? You can also send mass notifications to the rest of your customers regardless of their current location.

### How do I know if this is right for my business?

There are two factors to consider if proximity notifications are right for your business:

1. Your business has a consistent physical location Example: retail, restaurants, Beauty Salon, Car Wash, Bakery, Florist
2. Your business offers good or services that are likely to be used by individuals at least once every three months.

### What else can this do for my business?

The notification system is so advanced it comes with the following features:
- Membership Cards
- Rewards Points tracking
- Coupons/Discount (distribute them to everyone or just some customers)
- Online purchases/Payments
- Two-way communications (let your customers ask you questions directly)

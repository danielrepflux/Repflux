Unforunately your customers also follow many other businisses, so your latest products and deals go unnoticed . The solution?

AR Smart Coupons allow customers to see what items are on sale through their cell phone by pointing their camera at either a printed coupons or real world objects in your store. When a customer scans the coupon they are taken to an updated webpage that shows your stores latest product deals. This means they can keep one printed coupon from your store and scan it wheneber they choose to see your latest promotions.

### Why it increases Sales

As shoppers we are conditioned to look for the best deals. The challenge is that our attention is being pulled in a thousand different directions when browsing online. By giving customers control over when they see deals and providing them with a quick/convenient way of accessing them they become likelier to purchase more often and spend more each time.

32% of consumers look for online coupons on a weekly basis

42% of consumers use targeted offers from their favorite stores

**60-70% of returning customers make a purchase!** Compared to only 5-20% for a new customer visiting your business the first time.

Most small retailers try to keep their customers informed via social media but consumers are swamped by multiple businesses everytime they log-on, by giving them a physical QR code they can check your stores best offers as often as they want directly on their phone.

### How do I know if this is right for my business?

There are two factors to consider if AR Coupons are right for your business: 

1. Your store has at least 3 items on sale every week
2. Social media posts for your store get many "likes", but they aren't leading to the amount of sales you'd like

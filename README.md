These codes are provided to each of your customers so they can take home and scan on a weekly basis to see your latest products and deals.

### Why it Works

Your customers want the best deals when shopping, so its important they keep up to date with your latest prices. 

**60-70% of returning customers make a purchase!** Compared to only 5-20% for a new customer visiting your business the first time.

Most small retailers try to keep their customers informed via social media but consumers are swamped by multiple businesses everytime they log-on, by giving them a physical QR code they can check your stores best offers as often as they want directly on their phone.
